<p> <mark>Margherita pizza </mark> is known for its ingredients representing the colours of the Italian flag. These ingredients include
    red tomato sauce, white mozzarella and fresh green basil. When all of these delicious flavours are combined on a
    hand-kneaded pizza base, <i> a universally-adored pizza is created.</i></p>

<mark> What is Veggie Pizza made of?</mark> It's fresh and full of flavor, featuring cherry tomatoes, artichoke, bell pepper, olives, red onion and some hidden (and
optional) baby spinach. You'll find a base of rich tomato sauce and golden, bubbling mozzarella underneath, of course.
